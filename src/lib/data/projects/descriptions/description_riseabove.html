    When you come together for a hackathon, you often feel excitement, a sense of wander, and perhaps even attempts to formulate plans for tasks you aren't sure you will be doing. When I attended <a class="blue-link" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/hackvan2025-vancouver-hackathon-by-faithtech-indigitous-tickets-1571577844639">#HACKVAN 2025</a>, I was excited to use my talent to solve a problem from a Christian perspective. Our team decided to build a full-stack Chatbot application that would utilize training data to provide users with awareness of their financial habits. My involvement in the hackathon was building the API and monitoring user testing.
