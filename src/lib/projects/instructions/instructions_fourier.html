<ol>
    <li>Use Javascript text field to create vector arms:</li>
        <ol>
            <li>setSpeed(n), changes the speed of animation by n times. It's very useful if you don't want to wait too long. Default value is 1.</li>
            <li>mainArm object has 2 functions, push and pushA:</li>
            <ol>
                <li>push(length, speed) - Accepts two parameters that determine length and rotation speed of the vector arm.</li>
                <li>push(length, speed, angle) - Accepts three parameters, third being the value from the starting position of the unit circle, ranging from 0 to 2PI.</li>
            </ol>
