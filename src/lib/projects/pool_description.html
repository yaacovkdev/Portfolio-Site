    <p>Suppose you observe a vaccum with a frictionless plane, or no plane for this matter, where you have an immovable wall and two cubes. One of the cubes is some mass n, and the other cube is of mass n * 100^m, where m is any positive integer. The two objects are only able to collide with each other and the wall. The two objects are also only able to slide in one axis. You have the second object moving in the direction of the first object, and the first object is between the immovable wall and the second object.</p>

    <p>For some odd reason if you count number of total collisions of these 2 cubes, the total number of collisions will produce the digits of PI! You can inspect elements in your browser when you see this application. I'm using a simple elastic function to transfer energies between two objects and make the first object simple travel in the opposite direction when it collides with the wall. The math phenomena is absolutely true. Perhaps you can use this setup to inneficiently discover new digits of PI. Your machine probably wouldn't last before the end of times though.</p>
