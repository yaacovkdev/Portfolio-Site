<p>Behold! The very first game I made with the Processing 5 library. I was discussing with my friend a simple JS graphics library to use to make web graphics fast, that could potentially be used for demonstrating various programming concepts. I ended up bringing some demonstrations to the canvas and also made a few web games. I decided to make this first game, that is similar to another game with a bird that flew between obstructing pipes, that looked like they were from the Mario Universe. Unfortunately the original game does not exist anymore, but many homages are still being made. This one's called BouncyJS. It's not quite as visual but the game mechanics remain similar.</p>
