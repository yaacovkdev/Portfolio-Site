<p>Behold! The very first game I made with the <a class="blue-link" href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a> library. One time, my friend suggested this library to me, because of it's small learning curve, I needed to create graphical applications for the browser. I ended up using this library to create some fun games, and interractive applications that target interesting math concepts. This is the first game I made using p5.js. Unfortunately the original game that BouncyJS is a homage to, does not exist anymore, but many similar copies are still being made. This game is not quite as visual but the game mechanics are similar.</p>
