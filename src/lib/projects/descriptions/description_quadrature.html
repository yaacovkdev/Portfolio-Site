<p>This is just a simple animation of demonstrating approximating definite integral with three quadrature rules over a Particular Function, with JavaScript, where the definite integral approximation is done by the browser, using the <a class="blue-link" href="https://mikemcl.github.io/bignumber.js/">bignumber.js</a> library. After the animation of the function along with midpoint rule approximation area polygons, finishes, the browser begins to  calculate the approximate area under the curve, using Midpoint, Trapezoid and Simpson's Rule to compare to precise calculation of Definite Integral of the function. </p>
