<p>After watching this awesome video that explains Fourier Series, made by <a class="blue-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown">3Blue1Brown</a>:</p>

<p>I decided to create a web app that takes a script and produces drawings from the added rotating vectors. Here are some really cool design patterns, you can try:</p>

<ol>
    <li>mainArm.push(150,10);<br>
    mainArm.push(150,-45);</li>
    <li>//This particular set of arms demonstrates the irrationality of PI<br>
        mainArm.push(200,20);<br>
        mainArm.push(200,Math.PI);</li>
</ol>

<p>The Javascript text field provides the opportunity to write javascript that will be used in  the sandbox environment that executes code within the sandbox of the canvas environment.</p>
