    This is a small cube game made with WebGL and the linear algebra libraries. I made it because I was interested in learning how linear algebra is used in computer graphics and made the environment for the cubes. The only libraries used here is the provided source code from the <a class="blue-link" href="https://www.interactivecomputergraphics.com/Code/Common/">Interactive Computer Graphics textbook by Angel and Shreiner</a> where functions only create different types of matrices and vector calculations. The actual matrix stack for rendering shapes in the created environment, shaders, and loading textures onto polygons had to be written from scratch.
