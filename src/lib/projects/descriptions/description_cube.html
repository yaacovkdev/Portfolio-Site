    This is a small cube game made using WebGL and the linear algebra libraries. I made it because I was very intereseted in learning how linear algebra is really used in computer graphics, by making the 3D environment myself. The only libraries used here is the provided source code from the <a class="blue-link" href="https://www.interactivecomputergraphics.com/Code/Common/">Interactive Computer Graphics textbook by Angel and Shreiner</a>  where the JS libraries simply create different types of matrices and vector calculations. The actual matrix stack for rendering the shapes in the created environment, shaders, and loading of textures onto polygons had to be written from scratch.
