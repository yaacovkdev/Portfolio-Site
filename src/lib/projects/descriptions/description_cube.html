    This is a small cube game made with WebGL and the linear algebra libraries. I made it because I was very interested in learning how linear algebra is used in computer graphics, by making the 3D environment myself. The only libraries used here are the provided source code from the <a class="blue-link" href="https://www.interactivecomputergraphics.com/Code/Common/">Interactive Computer Graphics textbook by Angel and Shreiner</a> where the JS libraries simply create different types of matrices and vector calculations. The actual matrix stack for rendering the shapes in the created environment, shaders, and loading textures onto polygons had to be written from scratch.
