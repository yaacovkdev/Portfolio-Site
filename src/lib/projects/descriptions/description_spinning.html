    This is the second game I made with <a class="blue-link" href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a>. I particularly enjoyed making the progressive difficulty of the game, and also making an event manager that progressively executes in-game events, including the increase of enemies speed, increase of enemy spawn frequency, and increase of player firing rate. I definitely took a lot of inspiritation from looking at <a class="blue-link" href="https://github.com/LordUbuntu/TDS/tree/final">"Top Down Shooter"</a> game made with <a class="blue-link" href="https://love2d.org/">LÃ–VE</a> by the same friend that recommended me p5.js. I wanted to create something similar, but for the web.

<p>I plan on coming back to this project and make an actual map, with enemies that can also fire back! I should probably implement some kind of collision matrix, to better manage interactions of object types. I still hope that you can enjoy Spinning in it's current state.</p>
