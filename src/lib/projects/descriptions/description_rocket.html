<p>This is the first WebGL project I made that I want to share publicly. For one of the assignments in the Computer Graphics class, everyone was given a task to create an animation for a spaceship to travel left and right, bouncing between the borders of the canvas and reversing its position. I got really carried away and wanted to create something bigger. The result has the ship controllable with the keyboard and implement smooth mechanics for its smooth turning.</p>
<p> I also spent the extra time to implement the change of background color, which works when you select the "Dynamic" option for choosing the background. The colors get changed through multiple oscillating functions for the value of the RGB colors, starting from a certain value, and the functions being offset. I used a very similar approach to making the dark dynamic background for the <a class="blue-link" href="/graphics">Graphics</a> page.</p>
