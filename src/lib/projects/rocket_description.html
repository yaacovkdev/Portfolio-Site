    <p>This particular project came from an Intro to Computer Graphics course when I was still in college.
    Originally we were supposed to make a fish out of graphic primitives and make it travel in only one axis.
    I got a little carried away and decided to add some fun features like blue orbs, dynamically changing background, <i>which was my inspiration for dynamic background in the /graphics page</i>. Perhaps the most impressive part about this project is that it's made with JS and GLSL, with no frameworks, nor APIs but uses linear algebra functions and communicates with built in Web Graphics Libraries in modern browsers. My later projects relied on APIs and other more high level programming because the libraries I used did most of the heavy lifting for me.

        Anyway, going back to my earlier comment about dynamic background color, take a look at <a href="/graphics">/graphics</a> route. The background color slowly changes forming different gradients.
        They change through oscillating functions, because I found this idea to work quite well with changing color in a "loop".

        Play around with Dynamic Background and see that the background changes between Red Green and Blue at a very bright level.
